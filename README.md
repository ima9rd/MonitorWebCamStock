# MonitorWebCamStock
Simple Python scripts to scrape and parse search results for various online retailers and check for webcams that are in stock. Note: BestBuy stock status is unreliable. Some items report as in stock until you attempt checkout, so do not always rely on these results alone.

This script requires ChromeDriver.exe to be placed in the same folder as search.py. This file can be found here - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/.
